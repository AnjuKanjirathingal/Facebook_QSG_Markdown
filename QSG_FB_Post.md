# Overview
Facebook allows people to share updates, photos, and ideas with friends, communities, and public audiences. A post helps you express thoughts, share moments, or communicate important information in a simple and engaging way.

A standard Facebook post can include text, photos, videos, links, locations, or emojis. You can publish posts on your timeline, inside groups you join, or on pages you manage. These posts help you start conversations, receive responses, and stay connected with your audience.

Posting is useful for personal storytelling and plays a major role in business communication. Businesses use posts to share promotions, highlight services, and reach customers quickly. Well-crafted posts improve visibility, build trust, and support brand growth.

* Images and videos have file size limits.
* Supported file types upload only.
* Group admins may review posts before approval.
* Large documents cannot appear directly in the newsfeed.

This guide explains how to create a post from a web browser or mobile device. It includes steps for adding text or media, selecting an audience, and using related posting features such as Check-Ins and Reels. These tasks help you share updates confidently and engage your audience effectively.
